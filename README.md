# Super Resolution Classifier

Image upscaling and restoration have experienced several advancements over the past decade, with many proposed methodologies achieving high-quality results. However, in the space of medical imaging, the use of image upscaling has not been widely explored. By leveraging a popular Transformer-based image restoration method called SwinIR, we will explore its impact on image classification tasks. More specifically, we aim to evaluate SwinIR's performance when combined with image classification models on COVID-19 X-ray data. Our findings reveal that image upscaling using SwinIR allows these classification models to achieve 2.5% higher accuracy compared to standard approaches (without enhancement).
